# Trivia Game
 In this project I tried to perfect my code writing and organizating,using concepts like DRY(Do not repeat yourself!),KISS(Keep it simple,stupid),YAGNI(You aren't gonna need it!), and respecting some rules about the functions.
This project does not have the best design...

I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
